        Description

      <p>
        It rains alot where I came from, so I wanted to make an optical illusion of the pouring rain with a little bit of depth.

        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        I started by making a grid loop, then animating how long each loop is with random.

        Reflections
      </h2>

      <p>
        I think the hardest part of this project is to come up with an optical illusion, and 
        thinking of the way to make it. I started this project out by making a look on the X
        exis and animating how many loops there are in the Y axis, but it didn't give the depth
        I wanted, so I ended up making the lines cross each other and pulse with colors of different
        value to achive the look I wanted.
