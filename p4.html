        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This is a breathing exercise clock that pulse with second(). 

      </p>

        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        I started by deviding the seconds by 20 to get the remainder as frame number, and 
        animated the pulse with circle size.
      </p>

       <h2>
        Reflections
      </h2>

      <p>
        I had to change my project last second so this is not my proudest work, but if I were
        to have more time with this project, I will probably find a way for the pulse to go 
        faster, and to change the color and opacity of the circles with each pulse.
