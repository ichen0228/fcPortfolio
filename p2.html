        Design Process

      <p>
        I started by reading discriptions Kushei gave me of her object, and ended up getting a photo of what the 
        bottle originally looked like. After knowing the form, I tried recreating it mostly with filleted rectangles and rotation.

        Reflections

      <p>
        Streamline designs are defintly harder to create than rigid forms, but equally as fun. I spent a lot of time trying to find hierarcy in all the push() and pop()s, so that the geometries that comes after aren't rotated multiple times. After having the habit of typing push() and pop() before adding in the rotations, it got a lot less confusing.
