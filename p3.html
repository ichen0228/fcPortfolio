        Description

      <p>
For this assignment, I created a face generator using customized variables.Instead of producing a single design , it generate a variety of results by using code to create a set of parameters.

        Design Process
      </h2>

      <p>
        I started by drawings of the start and end position of the faces, and mapped out how they could interact with mouseX, mouseY and random. For example, the creature changes with mouse movement on the X axit, the eyes follows the Y coordinates, and the faces changes with mouth click.

      <p>
        Streamline designs are defintly harder to create than rigid forms, but equally as fun. I spent a lot of time trying to find hierarcy in all the push() and pop()s, so that the geometries that comes after aren't rotated multiple times. After having the habit of typing push() and pop() before adding in the rotations, it got a lot less confusing.
