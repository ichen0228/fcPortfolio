        I made a Xitai, where the camera turns the person into a performer, and the text
        ottered would bw print on screen.

      <p>
        I think the hardest part of this project is to find code online that looks similar
        to what I want, and diceting it so it fits my need. Even though a lot of codes from
        others were implemented into this project, it took much longer than the project I 
        wrote myself since a lot of what other people wrote are with commands I haven't learned
        yet, and I had to test what each line of code means with trial and errors.
